Shotgun game

This game is similar to rock-paper-scissors.  Players can choose from three different moves: load, fire, block.  Here are the rules:
 * You have to load bullets before you can fire your shotgun.
 * Block can save you from being shot, but you cannot win the same if you only block.
 * Game ends when one of the players is shot.
